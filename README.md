# Module 17 - Supervised Machine Learning - Holding Repo

In this module we look at Supervised Machine Learning. This repo is a place to upload the different analyses we did through the module, rather than a full project. We looked at Modelling Linear and Logistic Regression, SVM Modelling, and measuring accuracy with Precision, Sensitivity, and the F1 Score. We also scaled and normalized data to perform analysis on. We dove deeper into Decision Tree and Random Forest Analysis, Gradient Boosting, and dealing with Class Imbalance by using Oversampling, Undersampling, and a combination of both.
